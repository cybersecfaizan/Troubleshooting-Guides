The objective of this guide is to provide clear troubleshooting steps for the most common projector issues. Many of these problems can be resolved by navigating the menu using the projector's remote. However, with numerous menu options available, it is not always clear where to navigate in order to address a specific issue. This guide aims to alleviate that confusion.


# Initial Steps for Troubleshooting

1. **Check Cable Connections** <br />
Begin by inspecting the cables connected to the projector. Ensure that the HDMI and power cables are securely inserted into their respective ports. A frequent issue arises when users disconnect the HDMI cable from their laptop and forget to reconnect it before their next presentation.

2. **If the Issue Persists** <br />
If checking the cables does not resolve the problem, refer to the specific guides below.

# 🖵 Issues with Projecting on the Screen

*One of the most common problems reported is when the projector fails to display properly or blinks intermittently. If you have confirmed that the HDMI and power cables are correctly connected, the cables themselves—particularly the HDMI cable—may be defective.*

### Temporary Fix: Screen Mirroring

A temporary solution that often works is to configure screen mirroring between your laptop and the projector. Here’s how to do it:

1. **Access the Projector Menu** <br />
Press the “Home” button on the projector’s remote. This will display various input options.

Be aware that there may be a slight input lag for the audience when using screen mirroring.

# ↔️ ↕️ Adjusting Projector Height

*Another common complaint is that a projector is projecting “too high” or “too low” in relation to the whiteboard. The consequence of this is that the content displayed is not positioned optimally for students to view.*

## Steps to Adjust the Projector Height

1. **Access the Menu**<br />
Press the **Menu** button on the Epson remote.

5. **Confirm with the User**<br />
Be sure to confirm with the User that the new screen position is acceptable.

1. **Access the Menu**<br />
Press the **Menu** button on the remote control.
